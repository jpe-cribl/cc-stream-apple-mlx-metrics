# `.github/` — workflows for this template

Reusable workflows are called from any dryvist Cribl pack with a `uses:` ref:
`dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template/.github/workflows/<file>@<sha>`.
Pins use a 40-hex commit and a version comment such as `# vX.Y.Z`.

Caller workflows in this repo (`test.yml`, `release.yml`, `release-please.yml`)
wire them up to GitHub events.

## Installation

These workflows install themselves implicitly when a new pack scaffolds from
`dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template` (`gh repo create --template`). The caller
workflows under `.github/workflows/` are copied verbatim; the reusable
workflows they reference resolve at runtime against
`dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template/.github/workflows/<file>@<40-hex-sha> # vX.Y.Z`.

If you're adding a workflow to a non-template repo manually, copy the relevant
caller from this directory into your repo's `.github/workflows/` and adjust
the `uses:` ref to pin a different template release. First-party reusable
workflows use `@<40-hex-sha>` with a `# vX.Y.Z` version comment.

## Usage

Once installed, the workflows trigger automatically:

- Open a PR touching `default/`, `data/samples/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, or
  `package.json` → `test.yml` runs validate + Vitest.
- Push to `main` → `release-please.yml` opens or updates the release PR.
- Merge a release PR → release-please tags the version, which triggers
  `release.yml` → builds the `.crbl` and publishes to GitHub Releases.

No manual invocation is needed. Override defaults by editing the caller
workflow's `with:` block (e.g., pass a custom `cribl_versions` JSON array to
test specific upstream Cribl releases).

## Reusable workflows

The pack test and release workflows are reusable workflows hosted in
[`dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template`](https://github.com/dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template)
(`cribl-pack-test.yml`, `cribl-pack-release.yml`); their inputs and jobs
are documented there.

## Caller workflows in this repo

- `workflows/test.yml` — PRs and paths-filtered pushes to `main`; calls
  `cribl-pack-test.yml` from
  `dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template`.
- `workflows/release.yml` — pushes to `main` and pull requests; calls
  `_release.yml`, then `cribl-pack-release.yml` from
  `dryvist/cc-edge-pack-template` before publishing.

## Updating reusable workflow inputs

Adding/renaming an input is a breaking change for every consumer pack. Use the
`workflow_call.inputs.<name>.default` field to keep the change backward
compatible whenever possible. Bump major version of the workflow only if you
absolutely cannot.

## Pinning external actions

Per [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/JacobPEvans/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md):

- Trusted (`actions/*`, `pnpm/action-setup`, `softprops/action-gh-release`):
  semver tag pins (`@v4`, etc.)
- Untrusted (everything else): SHA pins. Renovate (per the org's
  `renovate.json`) auto-converts version tags to SHA on first run.
